# **Predicting Fraud in Electricity and Gas Consumption** 

## **Overview**

This project aims to investigate the effectiveness of the following machine learning algorithms in predicting fraud in electricity and gas consumption.
* **Logistic Regression** (LR), implemented via scikit-learn
* **Support Vector Machine** (SVM), implemented via scikit-learn
* **Extreme Gradient Boosting** (XGB), implemented via xgboost

Fraudulent consumption of electricity and gas results in financial losses that are not only borne by distribution companies, but are also passed onto consumers in most cases. Additionally, illicit tampering with distribution networks compromises the reliability of the power grid and poses a risk to public safety (Plummer 2025). This problem is particularly acute in developing countries, with losses amounting to more than 5% of total energy generated in Brazil and Mexico. (Flick and Morehouse 2010).
